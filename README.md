# Deep-Learning-Project-Street-View-Housing-Number-Digit-Recognition
This project focuses on recognizing house numbers from street-level images using deep learning techniques. The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, which includes over 600,000 labeled digits, is utilized to train and evaluate various models. The goal is to accurately predict the numbers depicted in these images.

**Objective**

The primary objective is to develop and compare the performance of different Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. The best-performing model will be selected based on its ability to accurately recognize and transcribe house numbers from the images.

**Dataset**

The dataset used is a subset of the original SVHN dataset provided as a .h5 file, which has undergone basic preprocessing. This subset is chosen to save computation time while still providing a robust sample for training and evaluation.

**Methodology**

**Data Preprocessing:** Basic preprocessing steps have been applied to prepare the data for model training.

**Model Development:**
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN): Various architectures of fully connected feed-forward neural networks will be implemented and evaluated.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Multiple CNN architectures will be explored to leverage their strength in image recognition tasks.

**Model Evaluation:** The performance of each model will be assessed, and the best-performing model will be selected based on accuracy and other relevant metrics.

**Significance**

This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to real-world image recognition tasks, showcasing the potential of machine learning in enhancing automated systems like Google Maps through accurate address transcription from street-level imagery.
