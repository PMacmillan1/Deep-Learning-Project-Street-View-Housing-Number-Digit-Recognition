# Deep-Learning-Project-Street-View-Housing-Number-Digit-Recognition
This project focuses on recognizing house numbers from street-level images using deep learning techniques. The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset, which includes over 600,000 labeled digits, is utilized to train and evaluate various models. The goal is to accurately predict the numbers depicted in these images.
